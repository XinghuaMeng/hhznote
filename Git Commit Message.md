1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

   Simplify serialize.h's exception handling

   Remove the 'state' and 'exceptmask' from serialize.h's stream
   implementations, as well as related methods.

   As exceptmask always included 'failbit', and setstate was always
   called with bits = failbit, all it did was immediately raise an
   exception. Get rid of those variables, and replace the setstate
   with direct exception throwing (which also removes some dead
   code).

   As a result, good() is never reached after a failure (there are
   only 2 calls, one of which is in tests), and can just be replaced
   by !eof().

   fail(), clear(n) and exceptions() are just never called. Delete
   them.

##好处
- 精心设计的 Git 提交消息是向其他开发人员（以及他们未来的自己）传达有关更改的上下文的最佳方式
- A well-crafted Git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to fellow developers (and indeed to their future selves).
- 一个项目的长期成功取决于它的可维护性
- A project’s long-term success rests (among other things) on its maintainability
